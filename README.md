# MyFully-Server-Side-App
A fully functionality standalone server-side app using Node, Express, MongoDB. 
This stores user data implemented with Mongoose.
I built the user API endpoints for CRUD operation, implemented with Express.
The secured app was implemented with JWT and express-jwt using auth for protected routes.
I used Advanced REST Client(ARC), a chrome extension app to test my API.
Advanced REST Client is an Opensource API Testing tool.
